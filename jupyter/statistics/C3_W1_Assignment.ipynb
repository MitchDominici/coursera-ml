    "Let's recap some concepts and formalize them to facilitate coding. Don't worry, you will be guided throughout the entire assignment!\n",
    "\n",
    "A random variable $X$ is a function that represents a random phenomenon, meaning its exact value cannot be determined. However, probabilities can be assigned to a set of possible values it can take. For example, if $X$ has a uniform distribution on $[2, 4]$, we cannot determine the exact value of $X$, but we can say with a probability of $1$ that the value lies between $[2, 4]$. We can also say that:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathbf P(X \\leq 3) = \\frac{1}{2}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $3$ is the midpoint of the interval $[2, 4]$. Therefore, you have learned that a random variable is associated with a function called the probability density function (PDF), which encodes the probability of the random variable falling within a given range. In other words, if $X$ is a continuous random variable and $f$ is its pdf, then:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathbf P(a \\leq X \\leq b) = \\text{Area of } f \\text{ between } a \\text{ and } b$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In the discrete case, $\\mathbf P(X = a) = f(a)$. In any case, $\\mathbf P(-\\infty < X < +\\infty) = 1$ because a random variable takes values on real numbers, and you're covering all possible outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another function associated with a random variable is the cumulative distribution function (CDF), denoted as $F$. It represents the probability that a random variable $X$ will be less than or equal to $x$, for any $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$F(x) := \\mathbf P(X \\leq x), \\quad \\forall x \\in \\mathbb{R}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The CDF is a non-decreasing function and approaches $1$ as $x$ approaches infinity because it represents a probability and must yield a value between $0$ and $1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the lectures, you learned that if $X$ is a random variable with cdf $F$, then $F(X)$ follows a uniform distribution between $0$ and $1$. In other words, the new random variable $F(X)$ will be uniformly distributed between $0$ and $1$. This opens up the possibility of generating artificial data with any desired distribution, given that we know $F$. The process is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Generate a random value $y$ uniformly from the interval $[0, 1]$.\n",
    "2. Compute $F^{-1}(y)$, which is the inverse function of $F$ evaluated at $y$.\n",
    "\n",
    "It can be shown that if $Y$ follows a uniform distribution between $0$ and $1$, then the random variable $F^{-1}(Y)$ has the same distribution as $X$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, by computing the inverse of $F$, you can generate artificial data from any known distribution! This is an incredibly powerful technique, isn't it?\n",
    "\n",
    "So far in the course, you have encountered three common probability distributions:\n",
    "- Uniform\n",
    "- Binomial\n",
    "- Gaussian\n",

    "## Section 2.2 Brief Recap on Naive Bayes Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's recap how the Naive Bayes algorithm works and formalize the notation. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let $X$ be a set of training data. An element $x \\in X$ is a vector in the form $x = (x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_n)$, where $n$ is the number of attributes of each sample. For instance, $X$ can be a set of 100 dog breeds, and each dog breed might have 3 attributes, such as ear head ratio, weight, and height. So, $X = \\{ \\text{dog}_1, \\text{dog}_2, \\ldots, \\text{dog}_{100} \\}$, and each dog breed, for instance, dog 5, will be represented as a 3-dimensional vector: $\\text{dog}_5 = (\\text{ear head ratio}_{\\text{dog}_5}, \\text{weight}_{\\text{dog}_5}, \\text{height}_{\\text{dog}_5})$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose that there are $m$ classes $C_1, C_2, \\ldots, C_m$. Using the same example above, suppose there are $m = 5$ different types of dog breeds in the training data. The idea is to predict the class of a sample $x \\in X$ by looking at its attributes. Naive Bayes does so by computing the posterior probabilities of a sample belonging to class $C_i$, i.e., it computes\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathbf P(C_i \\mid x), \\quad i = 1, \\ldots, m.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The predicted class is the $C_i$ with the highest probability. More formally, considering the set of every posterior probability of a given sample, what Naive Bayes computes is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{predicted class for } x = \\arg \\max \\left\\{ \\mathbf P(C_1 \\mid x), \\mathbf P(C_2 \\mid x), \\ldots, \\mathbf P(C_m \\mid x) \\right\\}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "So, if the highest value is $\\mathbf P(C_4 \\mid x)$, then $\\arg \\max \\left\\{\\mathbf  P(C_1 \\mid x), \\mathbf P(C_2 \\mid x), \\ldots, \\mathbf P(C_m \\mid x) \\right\\} = 4$.\n",
    "\n",
    "To compute the posterior probability $\\mathbf P(C_i \\mid x)$, we use the Bayes' Theorem:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathbf P(C_i \\mid x) = \\frac{\\mathbf P(x \\mid C_i)\\mathbf P(C_i)}{\\mathbf P(x)}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In this equation we use $\\mathbf P(x \\mid C_i)$ generically to indicate the distriution of $X|C_i$. If $X$ is a contiuous random variable, $\\mathbf P(x|C_i)$ should be interpreted as $f_{X|C_i}(x)$. Note that $\\mathbf P(x)$ is positive and constant for every class $C_i$, therefore, to maximize $\\mathbf P(C_i \\mid x)$, it is sufficient to maximize $\\mathbf P(x \\mid C_i)\\mathbf P(C_i)$. The probabilities $\\mathbf P(C_i)$ are called the class prior probabilities, and they denote how likely a random sample from $X$ (without knowing any of its attributes) is to belong to each class. This value is usually not known and can be estimated from the training set by computing the proportion of each class in the training set. If the training set is too small, it is common to assume that each class is equally likely, i.e., $\\mathbf P(C_1) = \\mathbf P(C_2) = \\ldots = \\mathbf P(C_m)$, thus only maximizing $\\mathbf P(x \\mid C_i)$ remains. We will work with the more general case here.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, it would be computationally expensive to compute $\\mathbf P(x \\mid C_i)$ for each $x$ and each class, this is why a **naive** assumption of **class-conditional independence** is made. This assumption states that each attribute is independent of each other attribute within each class. It is a strong assumption. For example, in our dog breed example, it would mean that for a specific type of dog breed, there is no correlation between its weight, height, and ear head ratio.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assuming class-conditional independence, for an $x = (x_1, \\ldots x_n)$ in $X$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathbf P(x \\mid C_i) = \\mathbf P(x_1 \\mid C_i) \\cdot \\mathbf P(x_2 \\mid C_i) \\cdot \\ldots \\cdot \\mathbf P(x_n \\mid C_i) = \\prod_{k = 1}^{n} \\mathbf P(x_k \\mid C_i).$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The probabilities $\\mathbf P(x_k \\mid C_i)$ can be estimated from the training data. The computation of $\\mathbf P(x_k \\mid C_i)$ depends on whether $x_k$ is categorical or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If $x_k$ is categorical, then $\\mathbf P(x_k \\mid C_i)$ is the number of samples in $X$ that have attribute $x_k$ divided by the number of samples in class $C_i$.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If $x_k$ is continuous-valued or discrete-valued, we need to make an assumption about its distribution and estimate its parameters using the training data. For instance, if $x_k$ is continuous-valued, we can assume that $\\mathbf P(x_k \\mid C_i)$ follows a Gaussian distribution with parameters $\\mu_{C_i}$ and $\\sigma_{C_i}$. Therefore, we need to estimate $\\mu$ and $\\sigma$ from the training data, and then $\\mathbf P(x_k \\mid C_i) = \\text{PDF}_{\\text{gaussian}}(x_k, \\mu_{C_i}, \\sigma_{C_i})$."

You can also refer to the `binom` documentation to find any other relevant functions that may assist you."
